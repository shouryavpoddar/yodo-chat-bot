# Yoda Chat Bot

This project is a web application built with Next.js, React, and TypeScript. It includes a chat component that allows users to interact with an AI assistant designed to mimic Yoda's style of speech.

## The Story Behind the Project

Once upon a time, in a galaxy not so far away, there was a developer named Shourya who loved both coding and the Star Wars universe. One starry night, while watching "The Empire Strikes Back" for the umpteenth time, Shourya had a brilliant idea: "What if people could chat with Yoda himself?"

Fueled by this whimsical thought, Shourya decided to bring this dream to life. With a blend of Next.js, React, and TypeScript, and a sprinkle of Tailwind CSS, the Yoda Chat Bot project was born. The goal was simple: create an interactive experience where users could receive wisdom and guidance from the wise old Jedi Master, Yoda.

Through this project, Shourya wanted to combine a love for technology with the timeless wisdom of Yoda, providing users not just with an entertaining chat experience, but also with the chance to learn and be inspired by Yoda's unique way of thinking and speaking.

May the Force be with you as you chat with Yoda and embark on your coding adventures!
